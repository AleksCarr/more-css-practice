# More CSS Practice

We're going to practice our CSS by trying to recreate some layout examples I've found around the web. You're probably familiar with these sites already, if not these specific pages. For each site, I took a screenshot of a particular portion of a page that employs some of the CSS tricks we've been learning. I also provided a folder for each example, so you can create separate pages with their own stylesheets. The code is up to you!

If you hit a wall, take a break. Go for a walk. Work on a different layout. Whatever you do, don't get frustrated. This will be a tough lab and I don't expect you to finish all of it. If you need to, you can also go find the page and inspect the code to see how they did it. Be careful though, they might be using things we haven't learned yet. You should be able to accomplish this with all the tools we've learned so far.

Some things to keep in mind:
- Layout is just styling boxes within boxes. Start on the biggest boxes and work from the outside in.
- Less is more when it comes to CSS. Adding more declarations than you need can make things too confusing.
- Try to use semantic HTML as much as possible.
- When you get something you like, use git to commit the code and save a snapshot just in case.
- **But most importantly, *Perfect* is the enemy of *Good*.**
